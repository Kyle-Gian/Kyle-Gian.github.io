        <h3>Short Brief</h3>
        <p>
          Over the last eighteen months I have been studying an Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment Sydney (AIE). 
          During my time at the AIE, my knowledge and passion for the gaming industry has grown, 
          as has my technical knowledge of programming and the skill required to create a quality game. 
          I have enjoyed creating Utilities and Game Mechanics within the Unity game engine, as well as learnig new techniques and 
          ways to optimise these Utilities.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            Since beginning my journey in Game programming at AIE Sydney, I have learned many new skills
            including Languages such as C++ & C#, data structures, code design and building games within game engines
            such as Rayllib & Unity.I have included some of my work below, which can be found in my Github.I predominately use the Unity engine
            when creating tools or games, but I am looking forward to learning the Unreal Engine and a bit more C++ in the process.

      <h5 class="card-title">Positivitea</h5>
      <p class="card-text">My favorite game that I have worked on so far is the first game I created as apart of a team called "Positivitea".
        I learned to work as apart of a game development team and learn new technologies and the intricacies of game development. 
        Since this game was also built to run in browser, The project need to be optimized during the build of the game and optimizations 
        had to be made due to the AI and Art assets that were included <br></p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Ragdoll Physics Runner</h5>
        <p class="card-text" >I created this small physics game to demonstrate the use of joints and Ragdoll effect using the Unity engine.
          It is a small obstacle course that involves basic puzzles. This project spanned over a couple of assessments at AIE, which were Computer Graphics and Physics for games.
          Some objects such as the wrecking balls or the puzzle cubes have shaders added to themwhich give different effects. An example of this would be the wrecking balls which 
          on impact show a sheen. This was implemented with the use of HLSL shader language.

        <h5 class="card-title">Node Based Behaviour Tree AI Unity Tool</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This project was done during my 2nd year at AIE and is a Unity package that can be dragged into a project.
        The user can create a behaviour tree using a node based visual graph within the Unity engine. The user can easily use the script templates given "Node Check" & "New Behaviour"
        given to them to create any type of AI they require for their project. I will be looking to adding to this project in the future.
        A feature I am looking to add is a visual debugging tool, which shows which nodes and edges are active in runtime.
        If you would like to view this project on Github 
        please click the icon or click the Unity icon to download the Unity package and add to your own project. </p>
